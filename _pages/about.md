Currently I am working as a Deep Learning Engineer at <a href='https://www.deeplite.ai/'>Deeplite</a> in Toronto. I am primarily working with compilers and runtimes to deploy Deep Learning vision models in low-power embedded devices. My research interests include hardware acceleration, computer architecture, hardware aware machine learning. I am passionate about designing deep learning solutions to challenging problems and deploying them to edge devices.

I have completed my Master of Science in Communication Engineering with a focus on hardware acceleration for inference at the <a href='https://www.tum.de/en/'>Technical University of Munich</a> in the <a href='https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lis/home/'>Chair of Integrated Systems</a> (LIS). Earlier, I spent time with <a href='https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/homepage.html'>Intel</a> working on Digital Design Verification and System Debugger tools validation. 

Besides spending time in front of a screen or tweaking hardware, I am fond of hiking, biking and do occasional landscape <a href='https://www.instagram.com/mr.se7enonline/'>photography</a>. Having "well trained" taste buds I am picking up with culinary skills. Here is a link to my outdated website.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
